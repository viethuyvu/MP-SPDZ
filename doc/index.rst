Welcome to MP-SPDZ's documentation!
===================================

MP-SPDZ is a framework for multi-party computation, a
privacy-enhancing technology focused on input privacy. It uses
protocols running between several entities to create a conceptual
black box in which data can operated on privately. Such a black box
could be created between banks or healthcare providers to jointly
operate on privacy-sensitive data. Please see `this gentle
introduction <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/300>`_ for more information
on multi-party computation.

If you're new to MP-SPDZ, consider the following:

2. :ref:`Machine learning quickstart <ml-quickstart>`
3. `Implemented protocols <readme.html#protocols>`_
4. :ref:`troubleshooting`
5. :ref:`io` lists all the ways of getting data in and out.
